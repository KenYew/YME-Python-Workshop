Notebooks are useful when executing small blocks of code for quick analysis, and using them as a record of results is advantageous. However there will come a time when you are required to write larger blocks of code that become increasingly complicated. A common method of handling larger coding projects is through using an Integrated Development Environment, or an IDE. An IDE provides a platform with which to develop and execute code, similar to Jupyter Notebooks. There are however some key differences that make an IDE an attractive way to code.\n","\n","For using Python, Anaconda comes with its own IDE application, known as Spyder.

The input console is useful for quickly testing some commands to ensure you understand their functionality but is unsuited for any significant code development. It is recommended that you code primarily in the script environment as this is saved to a file and will serve as a body of your work.\n","\n","#### Saving and Naming of Files\n","\n","When saving files, images or Python scripts take care to name them sensibly and in a relevant location. This means you should name folders or scripts in a descriptive manner that is easy to follow.\n","\n","#### Naming of functions, variables, and loops\n","\n","A lot of the work to come below will involve creating functions and using loops to carry out various tasks. With this in mind, and similar to the sentiment above, be aware of sensible naming. This means not calling every variable x or y; however it can also be tedious if you use overly long variables. There is a happy medium to be found, and if you are ever unsure then please ask a demonstrator.\n","\n","#### Layout of code\n","\n","When you move onto developing larger programs, you will begin to develop multiple functions and code blocks. Therefore it is important to have a structure with how this should be laid out to increase visibility. The following structural layout is recommended:\n","\n","- Import needed libraries\n","- Define any constants\n","- Function definitions that the code will use\n","- Main body of code\n","\n","The grouping of similar objects cuts down on clutter and makes the code more legible. \n","\n","#### Formally Exiting a Program\n","\n","Although it is not strictly required, it is good practice to formally end your code with the exit or quit command.
