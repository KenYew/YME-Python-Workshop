Often these methods require you to make an initial guess as to what the solution of the equation might be. They then iterate to a better solution. One very famous method for iteratively solving equations is the Newton-Raphson method which dates back to the 17th century. This uses the value and gradient of the function at the current guess to generate an improved estimate of where a function crosses the x-axis.
